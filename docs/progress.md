# Ops Progress

Last updated: 2026-06-16

## Current Phase
Phase 0.2 local/staging orchestration hardening.

## Completed
- Added v3 product strategy alignment: `docs/phase_roadmap.md` created with product-level phase status table, mandatory migration deploy checklist (migrations `a1c4e7f20b91`, `b2d5f8e30c14`, `c4e8b2d5f9a3`), and important corrections (Taxpayer Profile/Admin Review are `partial`, onboarding wizard/admin console/partner role are `future` high-priority, Moadian no-fake rule). `docs/product_strategy_and_phase_roadmap_v3.md` created as ops-repo concise copy/reference of the product strategy. CLAUDE.md mandatory reading updated to include `phase_roadmap.md` and `product_strategy_and_phase_roadmap_v3.md`. Commit message rule added. Ops coordination role clarified (not an app source repo; every deploy includes `alembic upgrade head`).
- Added Claude Code skills and subagents foundation: 5 project skills (`start-digi-session`, `deploy-digi-test`, `smoke-check-digi`, `review-ops-diff`, `update-blockers`) and 2 subagents (`ops-deploy-auditor`, `blocker-ledger-auditor`) under `.claude/`; CLAUDE.md updated with Skills and Subagents section.
- Docker Compose local stack for Postgres, Redis, backend API, and frontend.
- Backend build context points to `../digi-tax-backend`.
- Frontend build context points to `../digi-tax-frontend`.
- Environment example includes backend/frontend runtime wiring and restricted-network frontend build proxy variables.
- `scripts/bootstrap.sh` for DB creation and Alembic bootstrap inside Docker.
- `scripts/preflight.sh` for compose/env/readiness checks.
- `scripts/smoke_test.sh` for backend health, CORS, auth, dashboard, and frontend availability.
- README includes local/staging deploy workflow.
- Frontend orchestration updated for the production SSR Node container on port `3000` with build-time `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.
- Added a server deployment runbook for separate repo updates, targeted rebuilds, migrations, restarts, and validation.
- Cleaned up deployment documentation around the current `docker-compose` workflow, single Alembic migration command, targeted backend/frontend updates, and frontend rebuild requirements for `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.
- Fixed `.env.example` DATABASE_URL db name to match `POSTGRES_DB=digi_tax` (was `digitax`).
- Updated README project structure to reflect actual directory layout.
- Updated `phase_checklists.md` to reflect completed Phase 0 and Phase 0.2 state.
- Expanded `api-contracts/README.md` with OpenAPI snapshot export instructions.
- Updated `docs/current_state.md` to include nginx service.

- **P2.7 WeasyPrint migration (2026-06-11):** Backend `Dockerfile` now installs 7 WeasyPrint system packages (`libpango-1.0-0`, `libpangoft2-1.0-0`, `libharfbuzz0b`, `libfontconfig1`, `libcairo2`, `libgdk-pixbuf-2.0-0`, `shared-mime-info`) in a dedicated `apt-get` RUN layer before `COPY requirements.txt`. The `api` image **must be rebuilt** (`docker-compose build api`) before deploying this version. `fpdf2` and `uharfbuzz` removed from requirements.txt; `weasyprint>=62.3` added. No Compose, Nginx, or script changes required.

- **P3.0B–P3.5 Moadian foundation (2026-06-12/13):** Backend Moadian module complete with
  moadian_submissions table (`e5f9a2c1d7b3`), packet_uid column (`f3a8b2c1d5e7`), and
  moadian_tenant_profiles table. **All three migrations must be applied before any deploy.**
  Frontend: /app/moadian onboarding page, /admin/moadian-profiles admin approval page.
  Real submission blocked: 4 crypto methods raise `ProtocolNotConfirmedError` (pending
  RC_TICS.IS_v1.6 §7 algorithm confirmation). No fake taxid/referenceNumber at any point.

- **P3.5.8.x feature gating (2026-06-16):** Frontend-only changes (no deploy action, no
  new migrations). `useFeatureAccess` hook, `FeatureLockScreen`, `AccessLoadingCard`,
  RouteAccessGate (P3.5.8.1), in-component self-gates on payroll/employees/payslips/accounting,
  progressive sidebar by stage (P3.5.8.2). Redeploy frontend to activate on staging.

- **Docs sync pass (2026-06-16):** `docs/business_scope_freeze_v1.md` created as canonical
  scope document. `docs/phase_roadmap.md` updated with P2.7 done, P3.0B–P3.5 done, full
  migration checklist, and Release 1A/1B/1C structure. `docs/current_phase.md` updated
  to reflect June 2026 actual state. `docs/product_strategy_and_phase_roadmap_v3.md` open
  questions updated (WeasyPrint provisioning is done). Stale "Codex-driven" wording replaced
  with "Claude Code-driven" in active docs.

## Active Next

- Add migration-state verification to `smoke_test.sh` (check no pending migrations on `alembic
  current` vs `alembic heads`).
- Re-validate Phase 0.2 scripts against the current staging `.env`.
- Keep API contract snapshots aligned with backend OpenAPI (R1A new endpoints will be added).
- Wire Nginx for production TLS termination when ready (currently `nginx/placeholder.conf`).

## Known Risks

- **OTP in-memory storage** — launch blocker. Any container restart loses pending OTPs.
  Must be moved to Redis or DB before real users.
- **Migration-state smoke missing** — staging deploys can silently miss migrations. Must add
  `alembic current` check to `smoke_test.sh`.
- **Nginx is a placeholder** — `nginx/nginx.conf` is `placeholder.conf`, not in compose.
  Production TLS/proxy not wired.
- **CORS is wildcard** — must be restricted to known origins before production.
- Staging `.env` can drift from `.env.example` — review before each release.
- Optional services should remain out of the default Compose stack.
- Ops changes can accidentally cross repo boundaries if not kept scoped.

## Validation Policy
Use Docker Compose and shell syntax checks. Do not edit backend/frontend app logic from this repo.
